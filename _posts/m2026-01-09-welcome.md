I am a final-year **Global Economics** student at the **University of Central Asia (UCA)**. My academic focus is on monetary policy and macroeconomic stability.

Currently, I serve as a **Teaching Assistant for Econometrics** at UCA and lead the **Economics Club (OEC)** as President. I recently completed a research internship at the **State Bank of Pakistan**, where I analyzed global financial cycles and their impact on national economic indicators.

I am passionate about using economic research and civic engagement to drive meaningful change in the region.
