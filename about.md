### Background
<br>

I hail from the scenic **Yasin Valley** in the **Gilgit-Baltistan** region of Pakistan. Known for its breathtaking mountain landscapes and rich cultural heritage, this region has shaped my perspective on community and resilience. Growing up in the heart of the Hindu Kush range, I developed a deep appreciation for the unique socio-economic dynamics of high-mountain societies, which eventually led me to pursue my studies in Global Economics at the University of Central Asia.
